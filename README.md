## UX





This website was designed to have an Indy feel and somewhat rugged design in line with the bands music and image.
Currently they only have social media as a way of sharing upcoming gigs and use a third party for selling tickets.

The idea is that fans can come to this site to keep updated about the bands current schedule, see photos and to buy tickets.

The home screen is a center piece landing page. Just a carousel image block with a navigation bar. People who want tickets can purchase through one of the many links on the images or via the navigation bar.

There is also a facility to listen to the bands music via the spottily button clearly marked green on the carousel.

The about page is designed to highlight who the band members are, some of their back story with a scrolling parallax effect in the background of a music concert to further highlight this a bands website.

Further down the about page their is an i-frame for fans to sample some of the bands tracks without having to leave the page so for people who may be curious as to who the band are, they can get a feel for them here.

The gallery provides a nice visual presence with the main center piece one of the bands music videos in an i-frame from YouTube. This should grab the attention of browsers and if this type of music is to their taste they will
get what they came for.

The Contact us page is a form for potential bookings, sponsorship, or general contact. The bands main goal is to attract fans but the best way to do that is by playing gigs.

As this site does not have a back-end the form at this time does not actually collect data. This is not within the capabilities of CSS/HTML. However as a visual representation of what I would like the user to see,

once the form is submitted it will take the user to a success page advising them their message has been sent and the band will be in touch.

## Wireframes



Wireframes created with Balsamiq. Project was developed from initial wireframes however changes were made to the final project outcome. Wireframe located in <i>assets/img/wireframes/Emily7-milestone-wireframe.pdf</i> and you can find them [HERE](https://github.com/TheBigBushman/emily7-MS1/tree/master/assets/wireframes).

  



## Features



  

**Home Page**

Navigation bar with logo to the left of 5 links : Home, about, tickets, gallery, contact. Carousel of 3 images relating to the band with different links and brief css animation and footer to band socials

  

**About**

Scrolling parallax images with css animation, images of the band members and lorem ipsum sample text. I-frame linked to Spotify account for the band

  

**Tickets**

External link to ticketmaster.ie to the bands next upcoming gig for buyers to get tickets.
The main aim of the band will be to sell tickets to their gigs, users can do this easily by clicking tickets on the nav, or else one of the many buttons on the home page.

  

**Gallery**

Centered block i-frame to the bands music video on YouTube as the center-piece. These features highlight the bands music and creativity with an i-frame for spotify to their page and another to YouTube to one of their music videos.

So people wanting to know what the band are about can easily access this information Further down some sample images of the band in a gallery format.

  

**Contact**

Contact form collecting relevant information from prospective partners of the band or people just wanting to get in touch. Once a user completes the form it brings them to a sample success page
This is just a visual and no data is actually collected. This would be something that will ideally be functional in the future.

  

**Socials**

The band want people to be able to find their social media accounts and follow. These are included in the footer of each page of the site to make that easier and have them all in the one place.

  



## Features Left to Implement


  

 - Add CSS navigation and effects to images in gallery to allow them to 
   pop up when clicked on along with scrolling

 - Finish a functioning contact form that collects data
   

 - Add on a merch store for fans to be able to buy albums / branded   
   product

 - Direct ticketing portal so fans can buy their tickets on the actual  
   bands website as well as 3rd party sources.

## Technologies Used

**

**HTML**

Basic necessity for a web site

  

**CSS**

Required to style my HTML and images

  

**[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)**

Used to develop wireframes and I am extremely grateful for the licence to use this product for the rest of this year. Credit to Matt at CI for approving.

  
**[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)**

Provided useful components and layout features to create this website. Extremely powerful box grid system for developing websites with a responsive design.

  

*[*Canva](https://www.canva.com/)**

Used for editing photos and resizing


**[w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)**

Amazing library of full web framework components to pull from and assisted with understanding the structure of certain elements.

  

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/)**

Used for version control and storing and deploying website once complete.

  

**[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)**

Used this for icons and favicons for the likes of socials

  

**[Animista](https://animista.net/)**

Used Animista to create some moving visuals with CSS. Specifically the image overlays on the Home page H1 and About H1.

  

**[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**

Used google fonts to pick appropriate fonts for the band

  
**[Jquery](https://jquery.com/)**

Built in features of bootstrap to allow animations not available with just HTML/CSS. The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing

**

**Testing phase 1**
Beginning the project I have continuously tested for user experience and usability on multiple devices. 
Frequent usage of google developer tools to fix padding / margin and location issues of some of my components with css. 
In the early stage I was not using bootstrap as much as I have should have been. Because of this I used bootstrap but extremely limited amounts in creating the first layout.
This caused quite a few errors in terms of positioning.

**Testing Phase 2**
After I revisited the bootstrap section of the course and sourced material from the official bootstrap website along with YouTube for structural information I updated my website to ensure it was responsive and efficient for users.
Frequent testing on:

 - 22 inch Dell monitor
 - 17 inch HP Laptop
 - Samsung s8
 - I-phone-8

After each day of coding I would asses the usability and responsiveness of what I created and ensured it was functional.

**

**Testing Phase 3**

**
Tested each individual webpage on https://validator.w3.org/ when I was nearing the end of my project. Each page had between 6 and 10 errors. Mostly labeling issues with classes and spaces in comments.
There was one such issue regarding obsolete technologies regarding the width of the I-frame on the gallery.html page that has since been fixed. I consulted Stack Overflow for the reason behind this error.
Results of W3 Validator:

 - Home.html: Pass
 - About.html: Pass
 - Gallery.html: Pass
 - Contact.html: Pass
 - Success.html: Pass

 

**

**Testing Phase 4**

**
After some minor bug fixes and non visual errors I enlisted 4 colleagues to navigate the site. I wrote down 5 challenges for each.

 1. Locate where to buy tickets
 2. View the gallery and play the music video
 3. Contact the band
 4. Follow the band on social media
 5. Find out the names of the band members

  Within 3 minutes each person advised me they were able to navigate and find each of these without any issues and all tasks were successful.

Follow on testing from GTmetrix.com showed the page has a speed score of A (92%), A fully load time of 1.6seconds. Test server location: Vancouver, Canada using chrome.

Site tested using internet Explorer, Chrome, Google app, Firefox. Some slight delay in loading on IE but nothing too significant.
Displays and resolutions all fine. No user issues and website functioning fine.

> 
> Home tab not responding on contact & gallery page. Review of link
> addresses showed it was still marked as "#" towards end testing.
> 
> Contact form not requiring specific formats, ie Letters in phone
> number section and not requiring e-mail or any content for form to be
> submitted. Added in required fields on selected content and updated
> input Id's.


  

  

  

Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

  

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

  

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?

Different configuration files?

Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
