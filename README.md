<h1>Emily 7</h1>
<p>This website is to showcase up and coming band emily 7. 
It is a place for their fans to find out about gigs, tickets, check out their gallery and for prospective booking agents to contact them.</p>


<h3>UX</h3>
This website was designed to have an indy feel and somewhat rugged design in line with the bands music and image. 
Currently they only have social media as a way of sharing upcoming gigs and use a third party for selling tickets. 
The idea is that fans can come to this site to keep updated about the bands current schedule, see photos and to buy tickets. 

The home screen is a center piece landing page. Just a corousel image block with a navigation bar. People who want tickets can purchase through one of the many links on the images or via the navigation bar.
There is also a facility to listen to the bands music via the spotify button clearly marked green on the carousel.

The about page is designed to highlight who the band members are, some of their back story with a scrolling parallax effect in the background of a music concert to further highlight this a bands website.
Further down the about page their is an i-frame for fans to sample some of the bands tracks without having to leave the page so for people who may be curious as to who the band are, they can get a feel for them here.

The gallery provides a nice visual presence with the main center peice one of the bands music videos in an i-frame from youtube. This should grab the attention of browsers and if this type of music is to their taste they will 
get what they came for. 

The Contact us page is a form for potential bookings, sponsership, or general contact. The bands main goal is to attract fans but the best way to do that is by playing gigs. 
As this site does not have a backend the form at this time does not actually collect data. This is not within the capabilites of CSS/HTML. However as a visual representation of what I would like the user to see,
once the form is submitted it will take the user to a success page advising them their message has been sent and the band will be in touch.

Users who would have struggled to find tickets for the upcoming band now have a resource they can go to to get tickets, catch up on the bands tracks and in the future more features like news, blog updates etc.


***This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
